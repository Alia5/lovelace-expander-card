READ THIS FIRST:
Thanks for raising a expander card issue. Please take the time to review the following
categories as some of them do not apply here.

🙅 "Please DO NOT Raise an Issue" Cases
- Question
STOP!! Please ask questions about how to use something, or to understand why something isn't
working as you expect it to Github discussion or on forum https://community.home-assistant.io/t/expander-accordion-collapsible-card/738817/4.
- Managed Dependency Upgrade
You DO NOT need to raise an issue for a managed dependency version upgrade as there's a semi-automatic process for checking managed dependencies for new versions before a release. BUT pull requests for upgrades that are more involved than just a version property change are still most welcome.
- With an Immediate Pull Request
An issue will be closed as a duplicate of the immediate pull request, so you don't have to raise an issue if you plan to create a pull request immediately.

🐞 Bug report (please don't include this emoji/text, just add your details)
Please provide details of the problem, including the version of expander card and your Brwoser that you
are using. If possible, please provide a test case or sample application that reproduces
the problem. This makes it much easier for us to diagnose the problem and to verify that
we have fixed it
For quick troubleshooting, prepare a [minimally reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example).
