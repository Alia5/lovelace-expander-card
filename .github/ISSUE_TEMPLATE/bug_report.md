🙅 "Please DO NOT Raise an Issue" Cases
- Question
STOP!! Please ask questions about how to use something, or to understand why something isn't
working as you expect it to Github discussion or on forum https://community.home-assistant.io/t/expander-accordion-collapsible-card/738817/4.
- Managed Dependency Upgrade
You DO NOT need to raise an issue for a managed dependency version upgrade as there's a semi-automatic process for checking managed dependencies for new versions before a release. BUT pull requests for upgrades that are more involved than just a version property change are still most welcome.
- With an Immediate Pull Request
An issue will be closed as a duplicate of the immediate pull request, so you don't have to raise an issue if you plan to create a pull request immediately.

🐞 Bug report (please don't include this emoji/text, just add your details)

the problem. This makes it much easier for us to diagnose the problem and to verify that
